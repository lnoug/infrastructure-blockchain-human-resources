Introduction:
Blockchain is a decentralized and secure way to store records of transactions between parties. We will build a basic Human Resources application on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using a private Ethereum blockchain network. This app will allow employees to log work hours, request time off, review pay stubs, etc. on the blockchain, making the data transparent and secure.




Summary:
In summary, we built an entire private Ethereum blockchain network on GCP and a basic HR app on top of it. Employees can now log work hours, request time off, and view pay stubs on a transparent yet secure blockchain. The 3 nodes make the network decentralized and the encryption ensures all data and transactions are tamper-proof. By harnessing the power of blockchain on GCP, we've created an innovative HR system for the digital age!
